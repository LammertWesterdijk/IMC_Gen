\begin{opg}
Find the number of ordered pairs of integers $(a, b)$ such that the sequence\[3, 4, 5, a, b, 30, 40, 50\]is strictly increasing and no set of four (not necessarily consecutive) terms forms an arithmetic progression.


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
A permutation of the set of positive integers $[n] = \{1, 2, \ldots, n\}$ is a sequence $(a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n)$ such that each element of $[n]$ appears precisely one time as a term of the sequence. For example, $(3, 5, 1, 2, 4)$ is a permutation of $[5]$. Let $P(n)$ be the number of permutations of $[n]$ for which $ka_k$ is a perfect square for all $1\leq k\leq n$. Find with proof the smallest $n$ such that $P(n)$ is a multiple of $2010$.


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
For each positive integer $n$, let
\begin{align*} S_n &= 1 + \frac 12 + \frac 13 + \cdots + \frac 1n \\ T_n &= S_1 + S_2 + S_3 + \cdots + S_n \\ U_n &= \frac{T_1}{2} + \frac{T_2}{3} + \frac{T_3}{4} + \cdots + \frac{T_n}{n+1}. \end{align*}
Find, with proof, integers $0 < a,\ b,\ c,\ d < 1000000$ such that $T_{1988} = a S_{1989} - b$ and $U_{1988} = c S_{1989} - d$.


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
There is an integer $n > 1$. There are $n^2$ stations on a slope of a mountain, all at different altitudes. Each of two cable car companies, $A$ and $B$, operates $k$ cable cars; each cable car provides a transfer from one of the stations to a higher one (with no intermediate stops). The $k$ cable cars of $A$ have $k$ different starting points and $k$ different finishing points, and a cable car that starts higher also finishes higher. The same conditions hold for $B$. We say that two stations are linked by a company if one can start from the lower station and reach the higher one by using one or more cars of that company (no other movements between stations are allowed).

Determine the smallest positive integer k for which one can guarantee that there are two stations that are linked by both companies.


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
Let $1 \le r \le n$ and consider all subsets of $r$ elements of the set $\{ 1, 2, \ldots , n \}$.  Each of these subsets has a smallest member.  Let $F(n,r)$ denote the arithmetic mean of these smallest numbers; prove that



$F(n,r) = \frac{n+1}{r+1}.$
