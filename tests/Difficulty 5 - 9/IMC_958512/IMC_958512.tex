\begin{opg}
Let $a, b, x,$ and $y$ be real numbers with $a>4$ and $b>1$ such that\[\frac{x^2}{a^2}+\frac{y^2}{a^2-16}=\frac{(x-20)^2}{b^2-1}+\frac{(y-11)^2}{b^2}=1.\]Find the least possible value of $a+b.$


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
Is there an infinite sequence of real numbers $a_1, a_2, a_3, \dots$ such that
\[
a_1^m + a_2^m + a_3^m + \cdots = m
\]
for every positive integer $m$?

\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
Show that, for any fixed integer $\,n \geq 1,\,$ the sequence
\[2, \; 2^2, \; 2^{2^2}, \; 2^{2^{2^2}}, \ldots  \pmod{n}\]
is eventually constant. 

[The tower of exponents is defined by $a_1 = 2, \; a_{i+1} = 2^{a_i}$. Also $a_i \pmod{n}$ means the remainder which results from dividing $\,a_i\,$ by $\,n$.]

\begin{opg}
Let $P$ be a regular 2006-gon. A diagonal of $P$ is called good if its endpoints divide the boundary of $P$ into two parts, each composed of an odd number of sides of $P$. The sides of $P$ are also called good.
Suppose $P$ has been dissected into triangles by 2003 diagonals, no two of which have a common point in the interior of $P$. Find the maximum number of isosceles triangles having two good sides that could appear in such a configuration.

\begin{opg}
Let $\mathbb{R}$ be the set of real numbers. Determine all functions $f$:$\mathbb{R}\rightarrow\mathbb{R}$ satisfying the equation

$f(x+f(x+y))+f(xy) = x+f(x+y)+yf(x)$

for all real numbers $x$ and $y$.
