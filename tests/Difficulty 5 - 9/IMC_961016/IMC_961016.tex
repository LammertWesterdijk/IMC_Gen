\begin{opg}
A gardener plants three maple trees, four oaks, and five birch trees in a row. He plants them in random order, each arrangement being equally likely. Let $\frac m n$ in lowest terms be the probability that no two birch trees are next to one another. Find $m+n$.


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
The equation $2000x^6+100x^5+10x^3+x-2=0$ has exactly two real roots, one of which is $\frac{m+\sqrt{n}}r$, where $m$, $n$ and $r$ are integers, $m$ and $r$ are relatively prime, and $r>0$. Find $m+n+r$.


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
Prove that in the set $\{1,2, \ldots, 1989\}$ can be expressed as the disjoint union of subsets $A_i, \{i = 1,2, \ldots, 117\}$ such that

i.) each $A_i$ contains 17 elements

ii.) the sum of all the elements in each $A_i$ is the same.




\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
Let $\,n > 6\,$ be an integer and $\,a_{1},a_{2},\cdots ,a_{k}\,$ be all the natural numbers less than $n$ and relatively prime to $n$. If
\[a_{2} - a_{1} = a_{3} - a_{2} = \cdots = a_{k} - a_{k - 1} > 0,\]
prove that $\,n\,$ must be either a prime number or a power of $\,2$.


\end{opg}
\begin{opg}
Fix an integer $b \geq 2$. Let $f(1) = 1$, $f(2) = 2$, and for each
$n \geq 3$, define $f(n) = n f(d)$, where $d$ is the number of
base-$b$ digits of $n$. For which values of $b$ does
\[
\sum_{n=1}^\infty \frac{1}{f(n)}
\]
converge?
